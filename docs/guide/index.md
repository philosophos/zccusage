# Introduction

![zccusage daily report showing token usage and costs by date](/screenshot.png)

**zccusage** (better-claude-code-usage) is a powerful CLI tool that analyzes your Claude Code/Droid Usage from local JSONL files to help you understand your token consumption patterns and estimated costs with multi-provider support.

## The Problem

Claude Code's Max plan offers unlimited usage, which is fantastic! But many users are curious:

- How much am I actually using Claude Code?
- Which conversations are the most expensive?
- What would I be paying on a pay-per-use plan?
- Am I getting good value from my subscription?

## The Solution

zccusage analyzes the local JSONL files that Claude Code automatically generates and provides:

- **Detailed Usage Reports** - Daily, monthly, and session-based breakdowns
- **Cost Analysis** - Estimated costs based on token usage and model pricing
- **Live Monitoring** - Real-time tracking of active sessions
- **Multiple Formats** - Beautiful tables or JSON for further analysis

## How It Works

1. **Claude Code generates JSONL files** containing usage data
2. **zccusage reads these files** from your local machine
3. **Analyzes and aggregates** the data by date, session, or time blocks
4. **Calculates estimated costs** using model pricing information
5. **Presents results** in beautiful tables or JSON format

## Key Features

### 🚀 Ultra-Small Bundle Size

Unlike other CLI tools, we pay extreme attention to bundle size. zccusage achieves an incredibly small footprint even without minification, which means you can run it directly without installation using `bunx zccusage` for instant access.

### 📊 Multiple Report Types

- **Daily Reports** - Usage aggregated by calendar date
- **Weekly Reports** - Usage aggregated by week with configurable start day
- **Monthly Reports** - Monthly summaries with trends
- **Session Reports** - Per-conversation analysis
- **Blocks Reports** - 5-hour billing window tracking

### 💰 Cost Analysis

- Estimated costs based on token counts and model pricing
- Support for different cost calculation modes
- Model-specific pricing (Opus vs Sonnet vs other models)
- Cache token cost calculation

### 📈 Live Monitoring

- Real-time dashboard for active sessions
- Progress bars and burn rate calculations
- Token limit warnings and projections
- Automatic refresh with configurable intervals

### 🔧 Flexible Configuration

- **JSON Configuration Files** - Set defaults for all commands or customize per-command
- **IDE Support** - JSON Schema for autocomplete and validation
- **Priority-based Settings** - CLI args > local config > user config > defaults
- **Multiple Claude Data Directories** - Automatic detection and aggregation
- **Environment Variables** - Traditional configuration options
- **Custom Date Filtering** - Flexible time range selection and sorting
- **Offline Mode** - Cached pricing data for air-gapped environments

## Multi-Provider Support

zccusage extends the original ccusage functionality with support for multiple AI providers:

### 🔄 Zai Provider Integration

- Track usage when using Zai's Claude Code integration
- Support for Zai-specific model variants
- Accurate cost calculation for Zai pricing

### 🚀 GLM-xx, kat-coder Model Support

- Full support for GLM-xx, kat-coder models from various providers
- Token counting and cost calculation optimized for GLM-xx, kat-coder (beta)
- Compatibility with existing Claude Code workflows

### 🌐 Provider Detection

- Automatic detection of provider from usage data
- Separate reporting and aggregation by provider
- Unified interface for multi-provider environments

### 🎯 Moonshot AI (kimi) Support

- Full support for kimi models (kimi-for-coding, kimi-researcher, etc.)
- Automatic model detection without manual configuration
- Support for both `"kimi-..."` and `"moonshot/kimi-..."` naming
- Estimated cost calculation for Moonshot AI pricing

### 🤖 MiniMax Model Support

- Support for MiniMax models like `MiniMax-M2`
- Automatic provider detection and model matching
- Token counting and cost calculation for MiniMax models
- Compatible with existing Claude Code workflows

## Why zccusage?

zccusage was created to address a limitation in the original ccusage project: while ccusage focuses exclusively on Claude Code usage with Anthropic models, zccusage extends support to external tools/providers that use Claude Code/Droid with different providers like Zai, Dashscope and many models like GLM-xx, kat-coder, kimi, MiniMax etc.

The original ccusage project doesn't account for:

- **Zai** providers that use Claude Code infrastructure with their own models
- **GLM-xx, kat-coder** models from other AI providers
- **Moonshot AI** (kimi) models like kimi-for-coding, kimi-researcher
- **MiniMax** models like MiniMax-M2
- Multi-provider environments where organizations use different AI services through Claude Code

zccusage maintains full compatibility with ccusage while adding comprehensive support for these additional providers and models.

## Data Sources

zccusage reads from Claude Code's local data directories:

- **New location**: `~/.config/claude/projects/` (Claude Code v1.0.30+)
- **Legacy location**: `~/.claude/projects/` (pre-v1.0.30)

The tool automatically detects and aggregates data from both locations for compatibility.

## Privacy & Security

- **100% Local** - All analysis happens on your machine
- **No Data Transmission** - Your usage data never leaves your computer
- **Read-Only** - zccusage only reads files, never modifies them
- **Open Source** - Full transparency in how your data is processed

## Limitations

::: warning Important Limitations

- **Local Files Only** - Only analyzes data from your current machine
- **Language Model Tokens** - API calls for tools like Web Search are not included
- **Estimate Accuracy** - Costs are estimates and may not reflect actual billing
