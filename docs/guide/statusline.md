# Statusline Integration (Beta) 🚀

Display real-time usage statistics in your Claude Code status line.

## Overview

The `statusline` command provides a compact, real-time view of your Claude Code usage, designed to integrate with Claude Code's status line hooks. It shows:

- 💬 **Current session cost** - Cost for your active conversation session
- 💰 **Today's total cost** - Your cumulative spending for the current day
- 🚀 **Current session block** - Cost and time remaining in your active 5-hour billing block
- 🔥 **Burn rate** - Token consumption rate with visual indicators
- 🤖 **Active model** - The Claude model you're currently using

## Setup

### Configure settings.json

Add this to your `~/.claude/settings.json` or `~/.config/claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
	"statusLine": {
		"type": "command",
		"command": "bun x zccusage statusline", // Use "npx -y zccusage statusline" if you prefer npm
		"padding": 0 // Optional: set to 0 to let status line go to edge
	}
}
```

### With Visual Burn Rate (Optional)

You can enhance the burn rate display with visual indicators:

```json
{
	"statusLine": {
		"type": "command",
		"command": "bun x zccusage statusline --visual-burn-rate emoji", // Add emoji indicators
		"padding": 0
	}
}
```

See [Visual Burn Rate](#visual-burn-rate) section for all available options.

### With Cost Source Options (Optional)

You can control how session costs are calculated and displayed:

```json
{
	"statusLine": {
		"type": "command",
		"command": "bun x zccusage statusline --cost-source both", // Show both CC and zccusage costs
		"padding": 0
	}
}
```

See [Cost Source Options](#cost-source-options) section for all available modes.

## Output Format

The statusline displays a compact, single-line summary:

```
🤖 Opus | 💰 $0.23 session / $1.23 today / $0.45 block (2h 45m left) | 🔥 $0.12/hr | 🧠 25,000 (12%)
```

When using `--cost-source both`, the session cost shows both Claude Code and zccusage calculations:

```
🤖 Opus | 💰 ($0.25 cc / $0.23 zccusage) session / $1.23 today / $0.45 block (2h 45m left) | 🔥 $0.12/hr | 🧠 25,000 (12%)
```

### Components Explained

- **Model** (`🤖 Opus`): Currently active Claude model
- **Session Cost** (`💰 $0.23 session`): Cost for the current conversation session (see [Cost Source Options](#cost-source-options) for different calculation modes)
- **Today's Cost** (`$1.23 today`): Total cost for the current day across all sessions
- **Session Block** (`$0.45 block (2h 45m left)`): Current 5-hour block cost with remaining time
- **Burn Rate** (`🔥 $0.12/hr`): Cost burn rate per hour with color-coded indicators:
  - Green text: Normal (< 2,000 tokens/min)
  - Yellow text: Moderate (2,000-5,000 tokens/min)
  - Red text: High (> 5,000 tokens/min)
  - Optional visual status indicators (see [Visual Burn Rate](#visual-burn-rate))
- **Context Usage** (`🧠 25,000 (12%)`): Shows input tokens with percentage of context limit:
  - Green text: Low usage (< 50% by default)
  - Yellow text: Medium usage (50-80% by default)
  - Red text: High usage (> 80% by default)

When no active block exists:

```
🤖 Opus | 💰 $0.00 session / $0.00 today / No active block
```

## Technical Details

The statusline command:

- Reads session information from stdin (provided by Claude Code hooks)
- Identifies the active 5-hour billing block
- Calculates real-time burn rates and projections
- Outputs a single line suitable for status bar display
- Uses local pricing data for instant response times

## Beta Notice

⚠️ This feature is currently in **beta**. More customization options and features are coming soon:

- Custom format templates
- Configurable burn rate thresholds
- Additional metrics display options
- Session-specific cost tracking

### Cost Source Options

The `--cost-source` option controls how session costs are calculated and displayed:

**Available modes:**

- `auto` (default): Prefer Claude Code's pre-calculated cost when available, fallback to zccusage calculation
- `zccusage`: Always calculate costs using zccusage's token-based calculation with local pricing data
- `cc`: Always use Claude Code's pre-calculated cost from session data
- `both`: Display both Claude Code and zccusage costs side by side for comparison

**Command-line usage:**

```bash
# Default auto mode
bun x zccusage statusline

# Always use zccusage calculation
bun x zccusage statusline --cost-source zccusage

# Always use Claude Code cost
bun x zccusage statusline --cost-source cc

# Show both costs for comparison
bun x zccusage statusline --cost-source both
```

**Settings.json configuration:**

```json
{
	"statusLine": {
		"type": "command",
		"command": "bun x zccusage statusline --cost-source both",
		"padding": 0
	}
}
```

**When to use each mode:**

- **`auto`**: Best for most users, provides accurate costs with fallback reliability
- **`zccusage`**: When you want consistent calculation methods across all zccusage commands
- **`cc`**: When you trust Claude Code's cost calculations and want minimal processing
- **`both`**: For debugging cost discrepancies or comparing calculation methods

**Output differences:**

- **Single cost modes** (`auto`, `zccusage`, `cc`): `💰 $0.23 session`
- **Both mode**: `💰 ($0.25 cc / $0.23 zccusage) session`

## Configuration

### Context Usage Thresholds

You can customize the context usage color thresholds using command-line options or configuration files:

- `--context-low-threshold` - Percentage below which context usage is shown in green (default: 50)
- `--context-medium-threshold` - Percentage below which context usage is shown in yellow (default: 80)

**Validation and Safety Features:**

- Values are automatically validated to be integers in the 0-100 range
- The `LOW` threshold must be less than the `MEDIUM` threshold
- Invalid configurations will show clear error messages

**Command-line usage:**

```bash
bun x zccusage statusline --context-low-threshold 60 --context-medium-threshold 90
```

**Configuration file usage:**
You can also set these options in your configuration file. See the [Configuration Guide](/guide/configuration) for more details.

With these settings:

- Green: < 60%
- Yellow: 60-90%
- Red: > 90%

**Example usage in Claude Code settings:**

```json
{
	"command": "bun x zccusage statusline --context-low-threshold 60 --context-medium-threshold 90",
	"timeout": 5000
}
```

### Visual Burn Rate

You can enhance the burn rate display with visual status indicators using the `--visual-burn-rate` option:

```bash
# Add to your settings.json command
bun x zccusage statusline --visual-burn-rate emoji
```

**Available options:**

- `off` (default): No visual indicators, only colored text
- `emoji`: Add emoji indicators (🟢/⚠️/🚨)
- `text`: Add text status in parentheses (Normal/Moderate/High)
- `emoji-text`: Combine both emoji and text indicators

**Examples:**

```bash
# Default (off)
🔥 $0.12/hr

# With emoji
🔥 $0.12/hr 🟢

# With text
🔥 $0.12/hr (Normal)

# With both emoji and text
🔥 $0.12/hr 🟢 (Normal)
```

**Status Indicators:**

- 🟢 Normal (Green)
- ⚠️ Moderate (Yellow)
- 🚨 High (Red)

## Troubleshooting

### No Output Displayed

If the statusline doesn't show:

1. Verify `zccusage` is in your PATH
2. Check Claude Code logs for any errors
3. Ensure you have valid usage data in your Claude data directory

### Incorrect Costs

If costs seem incorrect:

- The command uses the same cost calculation as other zccusage commands
- Verify with `zccusage daily` or `zccusage blocks` for detailed breakdowns
